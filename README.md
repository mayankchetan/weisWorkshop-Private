# weis-workshop

## The idea
The participants will (re)designs the IEA 22-MW to a 20MW turbine with a smaller rotor

| 0800 – 0830 | Welcome & intro to WEIS                               |  Will ask users to get the Colabloaded. Advanced users to get their envs ready with latest WEIS |
| 0830 – 0845 | Setup Google Colab & familiarize with it.             |                                                                                                 |
| 0845 – 0915 | Baseline analysis and power curve of the IEA 22MW     | Focus  on pre-processing and post-processing                                                    |
| 0915 – 1000 | Aero-structural optimization for new site conditions. | Compare with baseline performance                                                               |

| 1015 – 1100 | Platform sizing with RAFT                             | We will also show how to load RAFT results into OpenFAST. Give pre-processed OpenFAST results   |
| 1100– 1130  | Controller tuning with OpenFAST                       | Comparisons before and after tuning the controller.                                             |
| 1130 – 1145 | Setup DLC runs with optimized turbine                 | Demonstrate postprocessing capabilities using pCrunch                                           |
| 1145 – 1200 | Recap, Q&A                                            |                                                                                                 |


- For computationally expensive optimizations we will provide pre-run results that can help move on to the next section.
- Analyzing & interpretating the results will be a major focus.
